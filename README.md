# Redmine EVM

V1.0.2 (19-Jun-2018)


## About

This plugin uses [EVM (Earned Value Management)](https://www.slideshare.net/GamaFranco/earned-value-management) a project monitoring methodology that measures the current progress of the project. By setting a project baseline it generates three key metrics, the planned value, actual cost and earned value and with these the plugin renders a line chart and performance indicators.

With this plugin you can:
* Manage and keep an history of baselines.
* Get information about the current project performance.
* Predict the project final cost and duration.

## Installation

1. Download tarball
2. `cd {redmine_root}/plugins/`
3. `mkdir redmine_evm`
4. Extract files to {redmine_root}/plugins/redmine_evm/
5. `rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=redmine_evm RAILS_ENV={Environment}`

## How to use

First make sure that the project planning is complete, then set up a baseline under the "Baselines" tab in the project settings.
